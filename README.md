Assignment2: Student Database Web Application

EXTRA FEATURES: (outside basic features)

1. Creating New Students or editing one
  - Only allows integer for weight and height, and only allows 0.1 step for gpa. All of those has a minimum number, weight & height = 1, and gpa =0
2. Layout/Design
  - Customize 'add students' link to a button, which apparently not easy as adding button on a link tag on plain html.
    This allows me to learn how to actually use buttons within rails, also how to use oper source css button library.
